# Python_startup_scripts
Just a couple of python scripts I use to reduce the need for willpower.

Just place these files in your startup folder (search > run > type 'shell:startup') and make sure that the .pyw extension is opened with python by default.

I made these to help me focus more during the daytime and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
